/**
Pipe Fitting Interface.

An `IPipeFitting` can be connected to other
`IPipeFittings`, forming a Pipeline.
`IPipeMessages` are written to one end of a
Pipeline by some client code. The messages are then
transfered in synchronous fashion from one fitting to the next.

    other fittings in a one way syncrhonous

    a reference to both sides of the pipeline in order to

    fitting is writing to, and so a message 
    may branch and arrive in different forms at 
    different endpoints.

    wrote into the pipe can take action, such as
